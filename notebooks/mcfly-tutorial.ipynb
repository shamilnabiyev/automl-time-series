As we do not know what architecture is best for our data we will create a set of random models to investigate which architecture is most suitable for our data and classification task. This process, creating random models, checking how good they are and then selecting the best one is called a 'random search'. A random search is considered to be the most robust approach to finding a good model. You will need to specificy how many models you want to create with argument 'number_of_models'. See for a full overview of the optional arguments the function documentation of modelgen.generate_models by running `modelgen.generate_models?`.\n",
